# Docker-Workshop

Docker-Workshop at Docker User Group Bamberg.

https://www.meetup.com/Docker-Bamberg/events/236555831/ 

To access the VMs we are going to use in the workshop you need a private key.
This allows you to access the VMs via SSH.

Depending on your OS you need either the SSH key for Windows or Mac OS X / Linux.
The SSH private key is named accordingly.

Windows users need to install PuTTY on their notebooks __before__ the workshop: http://www.putty.org/
